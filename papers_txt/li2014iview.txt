iview: an interactive WebGL visualizer for
protein-ligand complex
Hongjian Li1* , Kwong-Sak Leung1 , Takanori Nakane2 and Man-Hon Wong1


  Abstract
  Background: Visualization of protein-ligand complex plays an important role in elaborating protein-ligand
  interactions and aiding novel drug design. Most existing web visualizers either rely on slow software rendering, or lack
  virtual reality support. The vital feature of macromolecular surface construction is also unavailable.
  Results: We have developed iview, an easy-to-use interactive WebGL visualizer of protein-ligand complex. It exploits
  hardware acceleration rather than software rendering. It features three special effects in virtual reality settings, namely
  anaglyph, parallax barrier and oculus rift, resulting in visually appealing identification of intermolecular interactions. It
  supports four surface representations including Van der Waals surface, solvent excluded surface, solvent accessible
  surface and molecular surface. Moreover, based on the feature-rich version of iview, we have also developed a neat
  and tailor-made version specifically for our istar web platform for protein-ligand docking purpose. This demonstrates
  the excellent portability of iview.
  Conclusions: Using innovative 3D techniques, we provide a user friendly visualizer that is not intended to compete
  with professional visualizers, but to enable easy accessibility and platform independence.
